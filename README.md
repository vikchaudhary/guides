### [Your Corporate Strategy Is a Prisoner of History](./your-corporate-strategy-is-a-prisoner-of-history.md)

A reflective essay on **corporate reinvention and product-led strategy**.  
It draws from Vik’s experience transforming Keynote Systems from a narrow SaaS product into a broader customer experience management platform — leading to IPO and acquisition.  
Key ideas:

- How “experience” can trap strategy in the past (“We don’t do that”)  
- CEOs and PMs must act as *revolutionaries*, not *caretakers*  
- Case studies: **Slack’s future-first approach**, **Twitter’s broadcast roots**, **Microsoft + Salesforce’s reinvention through acquisition**  
- Lessons from leaders like Nadella, Benioff, and Jack Dorsey  
- Core maxim: *Disrupt yourself before anyone else does.*

> “Your company may be a prisoner of its own product history — act before history writes your fate.”
