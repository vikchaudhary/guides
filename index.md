* [Securing an Apache Server](/guides/securing-an-apache-server/)–A step-by-step guide to securing a web server from intrusions. This document outlines how to harden a Linux server after an intrusion, or to prevent intrusions before they occur. You will learn how to troubleshoot common issues related to server security using Apache, Fail2Ban, and UFW. Organized by topic, each section addresses specific problems encountered and their solutions. It is intended for system administrators, DevOps engineers, site owners, and anyone responsible for maintaining the security of their Apache web servers. It assumes a basic understanding of server administration, Apache configuration, and Linux command-line operations.

* [Blueprint for Platform Product Roadmap](/guides/blueprint-for-platform-product-roadmap/)–There are many resources for product managers managing consumer apps or B2B applications. However, there is a gap in PM’ing platforms–services, APIs  and tools that developers use to build applications–that are increasingly common in the AI era (e.g. OpenAI GPT, Cohere, and Google Vertex AI).  With Sid Palani’s and my experience PM’ing developer and ML platforms at Meta, we wrote an article on the challenges that people building platforms need to consider. We use 3 principles: Velocity, Leverage, and Impact to guide platform development.
